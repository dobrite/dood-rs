each cell has 3 angles
n = num cells in row
ar = 1.0f / (n +1)  "angle range"
sa = n*a            "starting angle"
ca = sa + (ar/2)
ea = sa + ar

Can't this be a lookup table?
(stride 2) per cell
[sa1, ca1, ea1, ca2, ea2, ca3, ea3]

process from orthogonal towards diagonal

visible obstacle found:
  store starting and ending angles
  next line and past any cells within this range are unlit
  increase num of found obstacles by 1
  difference total num and total num up to prev line

transparent tile:
  ca to be unblocked plus either sa or ea
opaque tile:
  any single unobstructed angle

most permissive: any cell visible if single unobstructed angle

when cell processed:
  iterate over blocked ranges on previous rows
  if not obstructed, cell is visible
